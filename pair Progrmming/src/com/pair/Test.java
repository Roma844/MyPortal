 Problem statement for tomorrow pair programming (1st batch consider yourself more responsible)

write a program in java to calculate the area, perimeter , circumference of following shapes (where ever what is applicable )
1) rectangle
2) square
3) circle
4) triangle
5) cylinder

essentials : should follow oops based coding and involve use of
a) encapsulation
b) abstraction
c) inheritance
d) polymorphism

example : ask user input for shape
if user inputs : rectangle
then it should ask about : length and breath
and then it should calculate area and perimeter of rectangle

if user enters circle: then it should ask for radius and should calculate area and circumference

if user enters triangle : then it should then ask for base and height, then calculate the area

if user enters : cylinder then it should ask for radius and height and then calculate area and volume.

public class Test extends Shape{
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		Test t1= new Test();
		t1.m1();
		
	}
